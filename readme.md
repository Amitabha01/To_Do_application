# 📝 Modern Todo App with Dark Mode

Welcome to your new favorite Todo App! This project is a beautiful, responsive, and feature-rich todo list application built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s designed to be simple, fast, and delightful to use—whether you’re on desktop or mobile.

## 🚀 Features

- **Add, Edit, Complete, and Delete Tasks**
- **Dark Mode Toggle** for comfortable night-time use
- **Responsive Design** for all devices
- **Persistent Storage** using localStorage
- **Modern UI** with gradients, shadows, and smooth animations
- **Accessible and Keyboard-Friendly**

## 🌟 Why This Todo App Stands Out

Most todo apps are either too simple or too cluttered. This app strikes the perfect balance:
- **Minimalist, yet powerful**: All essential features, no distractions.
- **Beautiful design**: Gradient backgrounds, elegant buttons, and subtle animations.
- **Dark mode**: Toggle instantly for eye comfort.
- **Instant feedback**: Every action is smooth and visually clear.

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. **Add a Task**: Type in the input and hit "Add Task" or press Enter.
2. **Complete/Undo**: Click the green ✓ to mark as done, or ↶ to undo.
3. **Edit**: Click the blue ✎ to edit any task inline.
4. **Delete**: Click the red × to remove a task.
5. **Dark Mode**: Use the toggle in the top-right corner to switch themes.
6. **Persistence**: All tasks are saved in your browser, so you never lose them.

## 📱 Responsive & Accessible

- **Mobile-first**: Works perfectly on phones and tablets.

- **Accessible colors**: High contrast and clear focus states.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
